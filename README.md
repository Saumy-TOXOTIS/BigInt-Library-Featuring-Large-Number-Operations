## üìà Example Usage:

### Example Code to Use BigInt Library:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "MyLib.h"  -- Include the BigInt library header

using namespace std;

int main() {
    -- Create BigInt objects from strings.
    BigInt a("12345678901234567890");
    BigInt b("9876543210");

    -- Perform arithmetic operations.
    BigInt sum = a + b;
    BigInt diff = a - b;
    BigInt prod = a * b;
    BigInt quot = a / b;
    BigInt rem = a % b;

    -- Output the results.
    cout << "a: " << a.toString() << "\n";
    cout << "b: " << b.toString() << "\n";
    cout << "Sum: " << sum.toString() << "\n";
    cout << "Difference: " << diff.toString() << "\n";
    cout << "Product: " << prod.toString() << "\n";
    cout << "Quotient: " << quot.toString() << "\n";
    cout << "Remainder: " << rem.toString() << "\n";

    return 0;
}
